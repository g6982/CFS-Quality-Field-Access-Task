"""Common Tests 

Inherit this class in any test classes to add functionality to send a helpful message to console for test pass/fail

If any errors are detected in the test, you simply append to the class variable `assertionErrors` like so:

try:
    self.assertTrue("something")
except AssertionError as aex:
    self.assertionErrors.append(aex)

Upon the teardown of eact test, if any entries are detected in `assertionErrors`, a message is sent in a print statement
in red text (on linux) that the test name has failed with the specified error. If no errors are detected, then a message is sent
in a print statement in blue text that the test has passed

TODO:
    a false pass can still occur if the written test runs into an error
